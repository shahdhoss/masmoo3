Why settle down to some humdrum uncongenial billet, when excitement, romance, danger and a decent living were all going begging together?\"- A. J. Raffles, The Ides of March.</i><br /><br />The Amateur Cracksman is the first collection of stories about A. J. Raffles, gentleman, cricketer, and thief. After stopping his old school friend, Bunny Manders, from a desperate attempt at suicide, Raffles introduces the unsuspecting Bunny to a new way of earning a living, burglary. Though frequently horrified by Raffles's actions, the conscience-stricken Bunny stands by him through all their adventures, firm to his promise, \"When you want me, I'm your man!\" (Summary by Kristin Hughes)",
